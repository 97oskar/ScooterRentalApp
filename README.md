# ScooterRentalApp

A simulation of an application servicing electric scooter rentals. The application allows you to create an account on the website, enter the data needed to rent a scooter and locate scooters available in the city that are currently not rented and rent a scooter chosen by the customer. The user also has the option of viewing his rental history.
